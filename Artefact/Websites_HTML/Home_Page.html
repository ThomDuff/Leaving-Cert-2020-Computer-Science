      <h1>Why does this happen?</h1>
      <p class = "BoxText">
        When CO2 is released into the atmosphere it is absorbed by seawater, a series of chemical reactions occur (shown below) resulting in the increased concentration of hydrogen ions.
        This increase causes the seawater to become more acidic and causes carbonate ions to be relatively less abundant.

      <h1>Impact it has</h1>
      <p class = "BoxText">
        Carbonate ions are an important building block of structures such as sea shells and coral skeletons. 
        Decreases in carbonate ions can make building and maintaining shells and other calcium carbonate structures difficult
        for calcifying organisms such as oysters, clams, sea urchins, shallow water corals, deep sea corals, and calcareous plankton.

        <br>
        These changes in ocean chemistry can affect the behavior of non-calcifying organisms as well. Certain fish's ability to detect predators is decreased in more acidic waters.
        When these organisms are at risk, the entire food web may also be at risk.
